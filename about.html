        <h3>Husband, Dad, Coach, Learner</h3>
        <p>
          I’m Chase – a husband, dad of two awesome girls, youth sports coach, and outdoor
          enthusiast who’s trying to grow a little bit every day. Between family time,
          coaching baseball and T-ball, working full-time, and sneaking in early-morning
          fishing trips, life is busy—but it’s also where the best lessons are.
        </p>
        <p>
          This site is a place to capture those lessons. The wins, the losses, the funny
          stories from the dugout, and the real moments at home when parenting feels both
          amazing and overwhelming. I don’t have it all figured out—but I’m committed to
          living the journey with intention.
        </p>

        <h3>Why I Built This Website</h3>
        <p>
          I wanted a space away from social media’s highlight reels where real life could be
          shared honestly. My hope is that another parent, coach, or busy professional can
          visit this site and think, “I’m not the only one,” and leave with something
          encouraging or practical they can try this week.
