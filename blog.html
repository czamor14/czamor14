    <h2>Blog – Stories from the Journey</h2>
    <p>
      These posts capture real moments from the field, the lake, and our living room.
      My goal is to share short, practical reflections that you can apply with your own
      family, team, or personal routine.

        <h3>Coaching Kids: Building Confidence Before Skill</h3>
        <div class="blog-meta">Youth Sports • Coaching Mindset</div>
        <p>
          Before we talk about throwing mechanics or swing paths, we have to help kids
          believe they belong on the field. In this post, I walk through three simple
          things I try to do every practice: call kids by name, celebrate effort, and let
          them fail safely. The scoreboard matters—but confidence lasts longer than any
          single game.

        <h3>Family Adventures Don’t Have to Be Big</h3>
        <div class="blog-meta">Family Life • Outdoors</div>
        <p>
          Some of our best memories haven’t come from big vacations—they’ve come from
          evenings at the park, backyard whiffle ball, and quick drives to the lake.
          I share a few “small adventure” ideas that work even on busy weeks and still
          give kids that feeling of exploration and connection.

        <h3>Lessons from the Coffee Bar</h3>
        <div class="blog-meta">Work • Personal Growth</div>
        <p>
          Working as a store manager has taught me as much about leadership as any book.
          From coaching partners on bar to handling tough customer moments, I’ve learned
          how important clear expectations, follow-up, and encouragement are—at work,
          on the field, and at home. This post connects those dots.
